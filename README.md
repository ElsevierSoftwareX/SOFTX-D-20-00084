# CycFlowDec
Cyclic Flow Decomposition Module

# Description
Takes a flow matrix representing a closed, steady flow network and determines the cyclic flow decomposition according to cycles defined by Min-Ping Qian's decycling algorithm [1]. The algorithm here accomplishes decycling by percolating the network with walks starting from an arbitrary node, and then logging the simple cycles encountered by those walks. More information on the percolating algorithm can be found in reference [TBD].

# Requirements
* Python3
* NumPy library

# Installation
Download CycFlowDec.py and place it in your `$PYTHONPATH`.  On a Unix system, this can be accomplished by the following:

`mkdir ~/python_modules`

Place `CycFlowDec.py` in `~/python_modules`. Update your `~/.bashrc` to include 

`export PYTHONPATH="~/python_modules":$PYTHONPATH`.

# Usage
Include `from CycFlowDec import CycFlowDec` in your Python script.  Instantiate the CycFlowDec class with `myCycFlowDec = CycFlowDec(F,state,tol)`.

`F`: NumPy (*N* x *N*) array. Flow matrix of the network to decycle, where *N* is the number of network nodes.  *F*[*m*,*n*] should correspond to the flow from node *n* to node *m*.
`state`: Integer. The arbitrary starting node for percolation.
`tol`: Float. The minimum contribution tolerance for walks to further percolate the network. Should be on the range \[0,1\]. For small networks (*N* ~< 6) `tol=0` should be fine.  For larger networks, `tol` can be be increased to accelerate percolation at the cost of maximum achievable accuracy.
